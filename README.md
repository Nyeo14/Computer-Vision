# Computer-Vision

These are a series of computer vision projects I completed for UCI's "Computational Photography and Computer Vision" course taught by Charless Fowlkes (Winter 2020-2021).

## Assignment 1: Demosaic <br>
This assignment consisted of two main parts. The first part was layering many similar images on top of each other to create an "average" image. The second part consisted of creating a demosaic function which took in a raw image and returned a standard color image (use of for loops was restricted).

## Assignment 2: Panorama <br>
The goal of this project was to create a panorama by blending together multiple images of the same subject taken at different angles.

## Assignment 3: Texture Quilting <br>
The goal of this assignment was to take an image pattern, then tile it and blur the edges of each tile to create a synthesized version of the image. For example, given a small patch of a rock wall, I could synthesize an image that looked like it could have been the entire rock wall.

## Assignment 4: Object Detection <br>
The goal of this assignment was to use HOG (Histogram of oriented gradients) to detect faces within images.

## Assignment 5: Face Morphing and Swapping <br>
The goal of this assignment was to use piecewise affine warping to morph one face into another. A similar application of this warping was used at the end of the project to perform face swapping.
